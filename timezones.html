This is the first post in the How Rails Works series. This post was inspired by a conversation I had with fellow IRC'er fowlduck about timezone issues our apps were encountering.

It all starts with the class definition on "line #649 of _railties/lib/initializer.rb_":http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/2-3-stable/railties/lib/initializer.rb#L649

<ruby>
  class Configuration
</ruby>

When you open up the +Rails::Initializer.run+ block in your _config/environment.rb_ the object you're given in the block is a +Configuration object+. What's more important in _initializer.rb_ is that it defines an +attr_accessor+ for +time_zone+ on "line #827":http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/2-3-stable/railties/lib/initializer.rb#L824-827:

<ruby>
# Sets the default +time_zone+.  Setting this will enable +time_zone+
# awareness for Active Record models and set the Active Record default
# timezone to <tt>:utc</tt>.
attr_accessor :time_zone
</ruby>

Pay close attention to this comment for this as it explains if you *do not* set this value your Active Record models will *not be timezone aware*. You've been warned. What this +attr_accessor+ does is set up a setter and a getter for an attribute on the instance of the class +Configuration+. When Rails initializes it reads this method using the +initialize_time_zone+ called on "line 152 of _initializer.rb_":http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/2-3-stable/railties/lib/initializer.rb#L152 and defined on "lines #553-570":http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/2-3-stable/railties/lib/initializer.rb#L553-570 as:

<ruby>
def initialize_time_zone
  if configuration.time_zone
    zone_default = Time.__send___(:get_zone, configuration.time_zone)

    unless zone_default
      raise \
        'Value assigned to config.time_zone not recognized.' +
        'Run "rake -D time" for a list of tasks for finding appropriate time zone names.'
    end

    Time.zone_default = zone_default

    if configuration.frameworks.include?(:active_record)
      ActiveRecord::Base.time_zone_aware_attributes = true
      ActiveRecord::Base.default_timezone = :utc
    end
  end
end
</ruby>

This checks to see if the +time_zone+ attribute on the +configuration+ object is set and if it is will go through the process of setting up the default timezone. This makes a call to the private method +get_zone+ on +Time+

By default this +time_zone+ method will be set to nil. It's up to you to set it in your _config/environment.rb_ file which you do by doing something along these lines:

<ruby>
Rails::Initializer.run do |config|
  config.time_zone = "Adelaide"
end
</ruby>

This will set the +time_zone+ value to be the Adelaide Time zone, something like: +&lt;ActiveSupport::TimeZone:0x30f4f8 @tzinfo=nil, @name="Adelaide", @utc_offset=34200&gt;+. You don't have to set it to Adelaide, just try your nearest major city and it Should Just Work &trade;. <u>If you <b>don't</b> set this in your <i>config/environment.rb</i> date and time values returned from the database will not be set to whatever time zone you specify.</u>


When your application loads it processes the config/environment.rb file and runs the +<a href='http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/2-2-stable/railties/lib/initializer.rb#L151'>initialize_time_zone</a>+ method which is defined <a href='http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/2-2-stable/railties/lib/initializer.rb#L496-508'>further down</a>.
This does all kinds of magic! Look at all the pretty sparkles! It firstly checks if you've set a time_zone in your <i>config/environment.rb</i> file and then if you have it sets the default time zone to be what you've specified. Additionally to this, it sets +time_zone_aware_attributes+ to true so that when you do stuff like +Topic.last.created_at+ it'll actually return the time zoned version of that time. It does this by calling into play +<a href='http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/2-2-stable/activerecord/lib/active_record/attribute_methods.rb#L167-177'>define_read_method_for_time_zone_conversion(attr_name)</a>+ (click for juicy details) which either just returns the time or calls +in_time_zone+ on the time returned which converts it into the time zone stored in +Time.zone+ (which is <a href='http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/2-2-stable/activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/time/zones.rb#L15'>actually +Thread.current[:time_zone]+</a> if there is one stored there or otherwise the +zone_default+ which was originally set when we called +config.time_zone+! What a mouthful!

By default, ActiveRecord will store timestamps as UTC as shown by +ActiveRecord::Base.default_timezone = :utc+. If you don't specify a time zone in your <i>config/environment.rb</i> this value defaults to :local, so all times will be stored as the local time in your database.

So, assuming you did as the above when you go into your script/console and type: +Topic.last.created_at+ you'll get back the time when the topic was created relative to Adelaide. To change this, just redefine +Time.zone+ by doing +Time.zone= "Paris"+ and then doing +Topic.last.created_at+ will give you time when the topic was created relative to Paris.
